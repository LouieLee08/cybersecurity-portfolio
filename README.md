## Certifications and Training
I am a newbie in network security and I donâ€™t have professional certificates or training.Sry for that.

## Project Experience

### 1. Network Vulnerability Scanning
- **Objective:** Conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment on a simulated enterprise network to identify potential entry points for attackers.
- **Tools Used:** Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus
- **Methodologies:**  
  - Performed port scanning to identify open ports and running services.  
  - Used Nessus to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the network.  
  - Analyzed network traffic with Wireshark to detect potential anomalies.
- **Outcome:** Successfully identified and mitigated 10+ vulnerabilities by suggesting firewall rules, patching outdated software, and enhancing network segmentation.

### 2. Password Strength Analysis
- **Objective:** Evaluate the strength of password policies and identify weaknesses in password configurations.
- **Tools Used:** John the Ripper, Hashcat
- **Methodologies:**  
  - Simulated brute-force and dictionary attacks on password hashes.  
  - Analyzed the results to determine common patterns in weak passwords.  
  - Generated a report with recommendations for creating stronger password policies.
- **Outcome:** Improved password security by implementing complexity rules, including minimum length, special characters, and password rotation policies.

### 3. Web Application Vulnerability Assessment
- **Objective:** Test a mock web application for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure authentication mechanisms.
- **Tools Used:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- **Methodologies:**  
  - Identified SQL injection vulnerability in login forms.  
  - Detected insecure cookie handling that exposed session IDs.  
  - Used Burp Suite to analyze and exploit reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Outcome:** Delivered a report outlining all detected vulnerabilities and proposed fixes, such as input validation and secure cookie practices.

## Learning Journey
My journey in cybersecurity has been both challenging and rewarding. Here are some highlights of what I have learned so far:

- **Learned Skills:**  
  - Mastered the basics of network scanning and vulnerability assessment.  
  - Gained hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit.  
  - Developed a foundational understanding of penetration testing methodologies.

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Cryptography remains one of the more challenging areas for me, especially when it comes to understanding advanced encryption algorithms.  
  - Malware analysis is another topic I find difficult, as it requires deep technical knowledge of reverse engineering and debugging.

- **Future Plans:**  
  - I plan to dedicate more time to studying cryptography concepts by enrolling in specialized courses and practicing with tools like OpenSSL.  
  - I also aim to improve my skills in reverse engineering by working on real-world malware samples in a controlled lab environment.

## Career Objective
As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, my ultimate goal is to specialize in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. I aim to become a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and pursue advanced certifications like the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). My long-term vision is to work in a dynamic, collaborative environment where I can contribute to securing critical infrastructures and preventing cyber threats.
